            <p class="lead">Just barely big enough for a "roughing it" week long trip with two young boys, and super
                comfortable. (The thing about being a Dad is that you have to carry a bit more for the things they
                forget.)</p>

            <p>And the daypack on the lid is actually usable! I like it enough to have sometimes taken it without the
                pack.
            </p>

            <p>I worried a bit with choosing the size, but the 60 hit the sweet spot for me. (Back in the day, we used
                to hump a lot more weight, because stuff back then stuff was HEAVY.) But in these days of modern
                superlight... I can fit 4-8 days for the three of us, and still feel agile on the trail. Other packs
                seemed great, but this one has made me happy!
            </p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>Some of the zippers are thin, and the pulls are small, and whatever... but weight is bad and nothing has
                broken yet, and the pack is almost as light as the "superlight" competitors. If you really want to save
                weight, there are alternatives, but spending two pounds on my pack being "nice" works for me.</p>

            <p class="lead">While getting ready for our trip abroad, we decided that it would be a good idea for both of
                us to have a decent sized backpack to use as our inflight personal item. After searching for different
                types of backpacks, we came across these ZOMAKE Ultra Lightweight Packable Backpack and decided to give
                them a try.
                <br>
                We received the two backpacks in small carrying cases, or so we thought, and decided to take one out to
                see just how big it was. While taking the backpack out of the carrying case, we realized that the
                backpack appeared to be inside out, but continued to remove it fully before turning it right side out.
                Once the backpack was fully removed from the carrying case, it then became clear that it wasn't a
                carrying case, but it was in fact the inner pocket of the main compartment of the backpack. The way that
                they made the inner pocket the storage and/or carrying case for the backpack is really a great idea and
                we like it quite a bit.
                <br>
                The backpacks are made from a resilient material, based on the sheer number of items we were able to
                cram into them, and they are elongated to a more natural feel while wearing them on the back. There's a
                small pocket located on the outside of the front flap and another one on the inside, which doubles as
                the storage/carrying case. There are also two net style pockets on both sides that were able to have
                ~16oz water bottle each. After our trip, we washed both backpacks with our laundry (nothing special from
                the rest) and they turned out looking like new, which is another plus to these backpacks.
            </p>

            <p>I was looking for a small daypack for an upcoming trip to India and Italy when I stumbled upon this one.
                It is everything I could want and more! It arrived in its small compact size and unfolded very easily
                into the full sized backpack. I was sort of shocked and almost thought I ordered the wrong item when it
                looked like a tiny satchel of some sort. The pack is decently sized and can fit quite a lot in it. The
                material seems sturdy and I can't wait to put it to use soon! The bag easily stuffs backs inside the
                compact packet making it ideal for traveling or camping when space is tight. Great buy!
                <br>

                This bag is EVERYTHING. I bought this bag thinking that I might use it here and there throughout my trip
                but I ended up using it everyday! It is made out of sturdy material - NO tears, rips, or broken zippers
                during my entire three week trip. All the pockets were used - water bottle holders on both sides, pocket
                on the outside, then a small pocket on the inside, and the main portion. I would buy this backpack in
                more colors and buy it for gifts in the future because everyone can put this bag to use. GREAT BUY! One
                of the most useful backpacks I have ever owned when it comes to a small compact backpack.</p>
