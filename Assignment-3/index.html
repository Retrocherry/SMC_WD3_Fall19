                        The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The
                        introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobile known as the pony car. The
                        Mustang’s styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host
                        of competition.

                        The Camaro/Mustang rivalry had begun in 1967 with the introduction of the Chevrolet Camaro by
                        General Motors. The Camaro was the largest threat to the lead Ford had in the "pony car" field,
                        a market segment largely created by Ford with the introduction of the Mustang in mid-year 1964.

                    gets together, eight well-kept ‘ponies’ are part of the celebration</h3>

                <p class="body mr-5 ml-5">Daniel Speed, 58, a rocket technician from Rockledge, Fla., on his family’s
                    Ford Mustangs, as told to A.J. Baime.
                    <p class="mr-5 ml-5 text-dark">
                        When my seven brothers and sisters and I were growing up in Valdosta, Ga., in the early 1970s,
                        we had a pony that nobody ever rode, because it was too small and it was mean. One day in 1973,
                        our father, Gilbert Speed, traded the pony for a 1965 Ford Mustang. He traded a pony for a “pony
                        car,” as Mustangs came to be known. That is how it all got started.
                    <p class="mr-5 ml-5 text-dark">
                        Our father owned a trucking company, so there were always cars and trucks around, and as
                        kids we would take them apart and work on them. When we grew older and moved away, our
                        youngest brother, Chester, kept working on cars with our father.
                    <p class="mr-5 ml-5 text-dark">
                        About 25 years ago, Chester and my brother, Lawrence, bought a harvest gold 1970 Mustang
                        Mach 1. That was the car that gave us all the Mustang crave, and it is important to our
                        family for another reason. That was the last car that our dad worked on, before he
                        passed away. Chester still has the car, and I cannot imagine him ever selling it.
                    <p class="mr-5 ml-5 text-dark">
                        Gradually, we all started buying these cars. Chester knew how to do all the work on
                        them, how to paint them and how to work on the engines. So every time one of us got a
                        Mustang, Chester would do all the work on it and make it the best that it can be.
                    <p class="mr-5 ml-5 text-dark">
                        About twice a year, we all get together in the town where we grew up, Valdosta, and we
                        bring our spouses with us. Usually my niece and some nephews come, so there are about 25
                        of us. We have eight Mustangs between us all, and every time we do something fun with
                        the cars.
                    <p class="mr-5 ml-5 text-dark">
                        My brother, Lawrence, the oldest, has a green 1969 Mustang Mach 1, and his wife,
                        Lucille, has a black and silver 1971 Mach 1. My sister, Jacqueline Speed-Isom, owns a
                        1994 Mustang GT. My brother, Leon, has a red 1973 Mustang convertible, and his wife,
                        Messo, rides in the front seat. My youngest brother, Chester, owns three Mustangs,
                        including a lime green 1971 Mach 1 and a 1970 428 Super Cobra Jet. I have a blue 1969
                        Mustang Mach 1, and my wife, Angela, rides with one of us. <br><br>
